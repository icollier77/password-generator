<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Project Goal
The goal of this project is practice intermediate JavaScript skills (especially functions) by building a web app that can generate a random password that meets specifications provided by the user.

### Project Specifications

<p>The task for this challenges outlined the following requirements.</p>

<p><b>Your application must:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Generate a password when the button is clicked.</li>
  <li>Present a series of prompts for password criteria:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Length of password: At least 8 characters but no more than 128.</li>
      <li>Character types:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Lowercase</li>
        <li>Uppercase</li>
        <li>Numeric</li>
        <li>Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  <li>Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.</li>
  <li>Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.</li>
</ol>

### Sample App

<p>We were provided with the original image of the web app:

![inital screenshot][initial-img]
</p>


### Built With

We were provided with files already built in:
* [![HTML][html-badge]][html-url]
* [![CSS][css-badge]][css-url]

Basic data was provided (such as arrays of character types). I wrote the code in:
* [![JavaScript][js-badge]][js-url]

<!-- The build process -->
## Development

I had 2 iterations of working on the assignment. First, I created an app where all character types were joined in a mega-array and a password was randomly generated from it. When testing this solution, I realized that this approach did not guarantee that at least one character from each selected character set would be included in the generated password.

### Important source
So I changed my approach. This [video][password-video] was very helpful in directing my thinking. I also used parts of the code mentioned in that video in my solution.
* Namely, I used the code shown on 14:05 in my functions `addChar()`.
* I also referred to the code shown on 16:22 in my function `finishPassword()`.
* I used the method shown starting on 16:53 to connect my JavaScript to HTML to make the button interactive and to print out the generated password into the textbox (rather than displaying it on the console or via an alert).

### Different logical approach

However, as the assignment specifications were quite different from this video, my solution diverged significantly. I had to ask the user for input (which character sets to use) and therefore, had to 1) validate the input; 2) loop if no valid input is provided.

### Adding randomization

I also did not like that all character sets, when joined together in a mega-array, still have a predictable structure. So I used the [code snippet 446][shuffle-array-url] from StackOverflow to create a function that would **randomize the mega-array** before the application picks additional characters from it to reach the specify password length.

The next problem I encountered was that while the generated password had the specified length, and its second part was generated from a randomized array, the first part still followed a predictable structure. So, I created one more function using [code snippet 64][shuffle-string-url] to **re-shuffle the password string** 10 times to ensure that the password order could not be guessed.

### Modular functions

I broke each set of actions into a function, trying to balance modular approach and the DRY principle. Then I united 4 functions in a single function `createPassword()` and connected it to the html `button` element.

The modular approach allows for easier testing and debugging during development and also helps for anyone else to see the logic flow.
