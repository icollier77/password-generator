<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## `About The Project`

### `Project Goal`
The goal of this project is practice basic JavaScript skills by building a financial console to analyze financial records of a company.

### `Project Specifications`

<p>The application should calculate the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The total number of months included in the dataset.</li>
  <li>The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.</li>
  <li>The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.</li>
  <li>The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.</li>
  <li>The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.</li>
  <li>The final code should print the analysis to the console.</li>
</ol>
</p>

### `Sample Result`

<p>The resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

![sample result][sample-img]
</p>


### `Built With`

I used the following technologies when building this application: 
* [HTML][html-url]
* [JavaScript][js-url]

<!-- The build process -->
## `Development`

Overall the process was very enjoyable. Taking those couple of weeks of [CS50x][cs50-url] finally paid off as I was very comfortable with the logic. I still had to look up a couple of things (such as how to _create an array from a array_, or how to calculate _min_, _max_, _average_ in JavaScript). 

I also went an extra mile and used `Intl.NumberFormat('en-US').format()` to present the numbers in a more readable format.

<!-- Deployed project -->
## `Deployed project`

The project is now live.

### `Deployed application`

The deployed page looks like this:

![Deployed page][deployed-img]


### `Links to deployed project`
